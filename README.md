# robotics
A language for robots to understand complicated movements required. Working on this as a hobby.

For those of you that are taking me seriously and think that you can actually implement this code, sorry, but its not possible. It's simply me trying to define my own programming language from scratch. (Which I guess isn't actually possible?)

Don't worry, justme having a play around with my knowledge :)
